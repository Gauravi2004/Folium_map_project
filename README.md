# Folium_map_project

This project uses Python, Pandas, and Folium to create an interactive map that displays volcano locations. Volcano markers are color-coded by elevation to easily visualize height categories. The map is generated as an HTML file that can be opened in any web browser


This project creates an interactive map showing volcanoes with markers colored by elevation.

- Blue: elevation < 1000m
- Green: 1000m <= elevation < 3000m
- Red: elevation >= 3000m

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install pandas folium
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```
    python volcano_map.py
    ```
